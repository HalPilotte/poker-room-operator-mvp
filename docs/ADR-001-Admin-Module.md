# ADR-001: Admin Module Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team  

## Context

The Poker Room Operator MVP requires a comprehensive admin console to manage poker room operations. The admin module serves as the primary interface for room operators to manage players, tables, tournaments, and operational settings. This module needs to be scalable, maintainable, and provide a seamless user experience for poker room staff.

## Decision

We will implement the Admin Module as a Next.js-based web application with the following architectural decisions:

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14.2.5 with React 18.3.1
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI) 6.0.0 for consistent design system
- **State Management:** React Hook Form 7.53.0 with Zod 3.23.8 for form validation
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack React Query 5.51.1 for server state management
- **Component Documentation:** Storybook 9.1.7 for development and testing
- **Backend API:** NestJS with TypeScript (services/api)
- **Database:** Prisma ORM for data persistence

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. Modular Structure
The admin module is organized into logical feature modules:
```
apps/frontend/src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── forms/          # Form components with validation
│   └── layout/         # Layout and navigation components
├── pages/              # Next.js pages and routing
│   └── [feature]/      # Feature-specific pages (players, tables, etc.)
├── lib/                # Shared utilities and configurations
└── theme/              # MUI theme customization
```

#### 2. Component Design System
- **Atomic Design:** Components are structured from atoms to organisms
- **Storybook Documentation:** All components have stories for development and testing
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with strict type checking
- **Form Handling:** Consistent form patterns using React Hook Form + Zod

#### 3. API Integration
- **RESTful API:** Standard REST endpoints provided by NestJS backend
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States:** Consistent loading and error UI patterns
- **Optimistic Updates:** Where appropriate, using React Query mutations

#### 4. User Experience
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with MUI breakpoints
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through MUI components
- **Performance:** Next.js optimizations including static generation where possible
- **Offline Support:** Future consideration for PWA capabilities

### Core Modules

#### 1. Player Management
- Player registration and profile management
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Player status tracking (active, suspended, banned)
- Historical play data visualization

#### 2. Table Management
- Table configuration and capacity management
- Real-time table status monitoring
- Table assignment and reservation system

#### 3. Tournament Management
- Tournament creation and configuration
- Bracket management and progression tracking
- Prize pool calculation and distribution

#### 4. Financial Operations
- Buy-in and cash-out processing
- Transaction history and auditing
- Commission and rake calculations
- Financial reporting and analytics

#### 5. Staff Management
- Staff roles and permissions
- Shift scheduling and time tracking
- Activity logs and audit trails

#### 6. System Configuration
- Room settings and operational parameters
- Integration configurations
- Security settings and access controls

### Data Flow

```
[Admin Frontend] ←→ [NestJS API] ←→ [Prisma ORM] ←→ [Database]
                      ↓
              [Real-time Service]
                      ↓
              [Socket.IO Hub]
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Validation:** Server-side validation mirroring client-side rules
4. **HTTPS Only:** All communications over secure connections
5. **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of admin actions

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Component testing with Jest and Testing Library
2. **Integration Tests:** API integration testing
3. **E2E Tests:** Critical user flows with Playwright (future implementation)
4. **Visual Testing:** Storybook visual regression testing
5. **Performance Testing:** Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Developer Experience:** Modern tooling and clear architectural patterns
- **Maintainability:** Modular structure allows for easy feature additions
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript provides robust compile-time checking
- **Performance:** Next.js optimizations provide excellent loading times
- **UI Consistency:** MUI ensures professional, consistent interface
- **Scalability:** Component-based architecture scales with team growth

### Negative
- **Learning Curve:** Team needs familiarity with React ecosystem
- **Bundle Size:** Rich UI framework adds to initial load size
- **Complexity:** Multiple libraries require coordination and updates
- **Server-Side Rendering:** SSR adds deployment complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive component documentation via Storybook
- **Training:** Team training on React/Next.js best practices
- **Code Reviews:** Architectural adherence through peer review
- **Performance Monitoring:** Regular performance audits and optimization
